# dfa-complement

C++ implementation of algorithms for automata transformation:
- Converts a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA with multiple initial states) to a minimized deterministic finite automaton (DFA) accepting the **complement** of the original language.
- Checks whether a given DFA accepts a specific word.

Includes subset construction, dead state handling, and final state inversion to compute complement automata.
The implementation is based on a university assignment focused on formal languages and automata theory.
